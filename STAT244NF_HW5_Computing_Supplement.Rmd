## NSF Computing Intervention

If needed, please review the two YouTube tutorials linked in Moodle under the homework for Week 4. Then answer the following questions.

#### Question NSF 1. Consider the following R code: `dpois(x=5, lambda=2)`

(a) What are the parameters in that line of code?


(b) What are the arguments in that line of code?


#### Question NSF 2. Are there default values for all the parameters in `dpois()`? Are there default values for *any* of the parameters in `dpois()`? If so, which ones? 



#### Question NSF 3. `dpois(x=5, 2)` and `dpois(2, x=5)` give the same output. Why?



#### Question NSF 4. `dpois(x=5, lambda=2)` and `dpois(x=5, lambda=2, log=FALSE)` give the same output. Why?
